This project was a really great way of solidifying a lot CSS layout knowledge. I definitely feel a lot more comfortable with using both CSS grid and Flexbox to create more complicated layouts. This includes positioning child elements exactly where I want them in the context of different grid and flexbox instances. 

I also feel like I have a much better grasp on responsiveness. I generally avoided fixed widths and sizes on this project and stuck to ratios and percentages so that I could better retain the default page structure.
